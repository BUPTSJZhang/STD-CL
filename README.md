# STD-CL
The official implementation of the paper 'Spatial-Temporal Decoupling Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition'

### Abstract
Skeleton-based action recognition is a central task of human-computer interaction. However, most of the previous methods suffer from two issues: (i) semantic ambiguity arising from spatiotemporal information mixture; and (ii) overlooking the explicit exploitation of the latent data distributions (i.e., the intra-class variations and inter-class relations), thereby leading to local optimum solutions of the skeleton encoders. To mitigate this, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupling contrastive learning (STD-CL) framework to obtain discriminative and semantically distinct representations from the sequences, which can be incorporated into almost all previous skeleton encoders and have no impact on the skeleton encoders when testing. Specifically, we decouple the global features into spatial-specific and temporal-specific features to reduce the spatiotemporal coupling of features. Furthermore, to explicitly exploit the latent data distributions, we employ the attentive features to contrastive learning, which models the cross-sequence semantic relations by pulling together the features from the positive pairs and pushing away the negative pairs. Extensive experiments show that STD-CL with four various skeleton encoders (HCN, 2S-AGCN, CTR-GCN, and Hyperformer) achieves solid improvement on NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks. The code will be released.
